                SurveyPro collects and stores the form responses that you submit. The form creator
                is responsible for this data and manages it. A form may ask you to provide personal
                information or data. If you have any questions about a form you are taking, please
                contact the form creator directly as SurveyPro is not responsible for the content of
                that form. The form creator is usually the same person that invited you to take the
                form and sometimes they have their own privacy policy. SurveyPro will not check all
                form contents created by our users, ie form creator and if you see any issues due to
                the form contents, you have contacted them directly to remove the content. You will
                need to ask the form creator as it depends on how the individual, company, or
                organization has chosen to configure the form(s). SurveyPro provides instructions
                describing how a form creator can ensure collected responses are done so
                anonymously. However, even if a form creator has followed those steps, specific
                questions in the form may still ask you for your personal information or data that
                could be used to identify you.

                or if you want to access, update, or delete anything in your responses. SurveyPro
                provides form creators with tools to maintain the responses they collect through

                hold about you by contacting customer support, however, in most cases SurveyPro
                cannot provide you with this access since form responses are the form creator’s
                private information (except if the form creator has made the questions and responses
                available via a public link) and giving you access may have an unreasonable impact
                on the privacy of other individuals. SurveyPro will respond to your request for
                access or correction within a reasonable time and, where reasonable and practicable
                to do so, SurveyPro will provide access to your personal information in the manner
